how to push your change:

step1: pull request
      command: "git pull origin master"
      purpose: pull request from remote, update to latest version. I would suggest you guys pull request first before any change you want to make.
      
step2: "git status": check current status of git
step3: "git add .": stage your change
step4: "git commit": commit your change
step5: "git push": push local change to remote.

* when you do push, please append your change date, reason you make the change, as well as the files you changed. Thank you!
